title: "What makes a bot a bot? Exploring benign automation on Twitter"
event: "DIGIKOMM2019"
event_url: "https://www.digikomm2019.de/index.html"
location: "Umspannwerk Kreuzberg, Berlin, Germany"
address: 
  street: Ohlauer Str. 43
  city: Berlin
  region: Berlin
  postcode: 10999
  country: Germany
summary:
abstract: "We present a study on bot detection and its interpretation by assessing the different types of automation that one of the most popular methods for bot detection, Botometer (<a href='https://botometer.iuni.iu.edu/'>https://botometer.iuni.iu.edu/</a>), detects. The study is based on the first project to assess the prevalence, influence, and roles of automated accounts in a Twitter follow network on a national scale: the German-speaking Twittersphere. This work in progress allows us to analyse the long-term structural role, impact, and possible audience of bots beyond the context of single events and topics."
