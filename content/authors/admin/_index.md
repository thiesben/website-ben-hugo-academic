Hi! I am Ben, a current Strategy Consultant at [Strategy&](https://www.strategyand.pwc.com/) and visiting scholar at the [Mercator Research Institute on Global Commons and Climate Change](https://www.mcc-berlin.net/en/index.html)'s [Sustainable Resource Management and Global Change working group](https://www.mcc-berlin.net/en/research/working-groups/sustainable-resource-management-and-global-change.html).

In the past, I leveraged my strong background in various social sciences paired with my formal training as statistician to research individual (link BA) and collective (link congestion) human behaviour, and to develop computational research methods (1: sms, 2: stylometry, 3:?). I like to add different methods and perspectives from other established fields of research to my own research from a different field, I like to observe how humans interact, and I like to work with data.

This is what brought me to my current profession outside of academia. As a strategy consultant, I help clients approach their challenges from new angles. I specialize in topics revolving technology strategy (e.g. data governance, ai strategy, IT strategy), with a focus on the public sector. My hope is that with my projects I can make a positive contribution to a better, more digital, citizen-centric public administrastion.

I am always happy to collaborate on scientific research - or on discussions about the digitisation of the (mostly German) public sector - just [hit me up](mailto:research@benthies.de)!
